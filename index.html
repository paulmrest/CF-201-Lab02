    <div id="intro"> 
      <p>
        I hail from California, in the United States, having moved to Seattle in 2005. I first became interested in software development, and computer science in general, in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being intested in topics like physics, mathematics, cosmology, literature, astrophysics, philosophy, and astronomy (both amateur and research) all my life, I asked myself around 2011 what all those things had in common. The answer was: information density. I adore anything that presents complex ideas elegantly and succintly. Considering what to do with that realization, it struck me that software development could be a rewarding path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several years, a few interrupted starts, and one <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flounds/id1059196121">iOS app</a> later, I am finally pursuing becoming a Software Developer full time with Code Fellows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am primarily interested in back-end development. I enjoy building things that perform complex tasks.
